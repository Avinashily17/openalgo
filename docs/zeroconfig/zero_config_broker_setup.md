# Zero-Config Broker Setup - Design & Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of OpenAlgo's zero-config broker setup system. The system has been **successfully implemented** and transforms OpenAlgo from a manual `.env` configuration system to a database-driven broker setup system with a web interface.

> **Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - All features implemented and production ready

## Current State Analysis

### Current Authentication Flow
1. **Manual Configuration**: Users must manually edit `.env` file with broker credentials
2. **Static Configuration**: All users share the same broker configuration
3. **Environment Dependencies**: Application requires specific environment variables to be set
4. **Limited Flexibility**: No support for multiple brokers per user

### Current .env Configuration
```bash
# Broker Configuration
BROKER_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
BROKER_API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret'
BROKER_API_KEY_MARKET = 'your_market_api_key'
BROKER_API_SECRET_MARKET = 'your_market_api_secret'
REDIRECT_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/dhan/callback'
```

### Current Flow
```
User Login → Application Authentication → Static Broker Selection → Broker Authentication
```

## Proposed Zero-Config Solution

### New User Flow
```
User Registration/Login → Broker Setup (if not configured) → Dynamic Broker Selection → Broker Authentication → Dashboard
```

### Key Features
- **Web-based Configuration**: Intuitive UI for broker setup
- **Multi-User Support**: Each user can have their own broker configuration
- **Multiple Broker Support**: Users can configure and switch between multiple brokers
- **Security**: Encrypted storage of sensitive credentials
- **Zero Configuration**: No manual file editing required
- **Migration Support**: Automatic migration from existing .env configurations

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `broker_configs`
```sql
CREATE TABLE broker_configs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    broker_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    api_key_encrypted TEXT NOT NULL,
    api_secret_encrypted TEXT NOT NULL,
    market_api_key_encrypted TEXT,
    market_api_secret_encrypted TEXT,
    redirect_url VARCHAR(500),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_default BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id, broker_name),
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(username)
);
```

### Database Model Features
- **Encryption**: All sensitive credentials encrypted using Fernet
- **User Isolation**: Each user has their own broker configurations
- **Multiple Brokers**: Support for multiple broker configurations per user
- **Active Status**: Enable/disable broker configurations
- **Default Broker**: Mark one broker as default for each user

## Implementation Plan

## Technical Specifications

### Encryption Strategy
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (AES 128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with existing `API_KEY_PEPPER`
- **Storage**: Base64 encoded encrypted values in database

### Security Considerations
- All broker credentials encrypted at rest
- Secure key derivation using existing pepper
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Rate limiting on broker configuration endpoints

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: TTL cache for frequently accessed credentials
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Lazy Loading**: Load broker configs only when needed

## User Experience Design

### Broker Setup Wizard
1. **Welcome Screen**: Introduction to broker setup
2. **Broker Selection**: Choose from supported brokers
3. **Credential Entry**: Secure form for API keys and secrets
4. **Connection Test**: Verify credentials before saving
5. **Success**: Confirmation and next steps

### Broker Management Dashboard
- **Current Configuration**: Display active broker
- **Multiple Brokers**: List all configured brokers
- **Switch Broker**: Easy switching between configurations
- **Edit/Delete**: Manage existing configurations
- **Status Indicators**: Connection health and validity

## Migration Strategy

### Automatic Detection
```python
def detect_env_configuration():
    """Detect if .env broker configuration exists"""
    required_vars = ['BROKER_API_KEY', 'BROKER_API_SECRET']
    return all(os.getenv(var) for var in required_vars)
```

### Migration Process
1. **Detection**: Check for existing .env configuration
2. **User Prompt**: Offer to migrate to database
3. **Migration**: Transfer credentials with encryption
4. **Verification**: Test migrated configuration
5. **Cleanup**: Optional .env cleanup

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain .env fallback during transition period
- Gradual deprecation warnings
- Migration assistance tools
